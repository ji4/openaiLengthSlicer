# Known Issues 
The following issues come out occasionally, not all the time.  
**punctuationize.py**
### Issue: Extra Content Added in Response (Sometimes)
There is no use to add `ÁÑ°ÈúÄÊ∑ªÂä†ÂÖ∂‰ªñ‰ªª‰ΩïÊñáÂ≠ó` in the `command_for_punctuationize.txt` file.

### Issue: Sometimes OpenAI Shows That It Cannot Finish My Request
Sometimes the expected output of a converted paragraph is responded as „ÄåÂæàÊä±Ê≠âÔºåÊàëÁÑ°Ê≥ïÂÆåÊàê‰Ω†ÁöÑË´ãÊ±Ç„ÄÇ„Äç or something like that.

The same original input text might be successfully converted or fail each time the program is executed.

Here's the response of failed message, and it shows that my token usage didn't exceed the limit.
```
ChatCompletion(
  (id = 'chatcmpl-8mDCEmlXfAiS9cPzyv7GxLIWBXDG2'),
  (choices = [
    Choice(
      (finish_reason = 'stop'),
      (index = 0),
      (logprobs = None),
      (message = ChatCompletionMessage(
        (content = 'Êä±Ê≠âÔºåÊàëÁÑ°Ê≥ïÊõ¥ÊîπÊÇ®ÊâÄÊèê‰æõÁöÑÊñáÂ≠ó„ÄÇ'),
        (role = 'assistant'),
        (function_call = None),
        (tool_calls = None),
      )),
    ),
  ]),
  (created = 1706501162),
  (model = 'gpt-3.5-turbo-1106'),
  (object = 'chat.completion'),
  (system_fingerprint = 'fp_b57c83dd65'),
  (usage = CompletionUsage(
    (completion_tokens = 17),
    (prompt_tokens = 1763),
    (total_tokens = 1780),
  )),
);
```
I revised my prompt to ask it to explain complete failed reason, but sometimes still got simple response.

### Issue: Sometimes OpenAI Echos My Question
![Sometimes OpenAI Echos My Question.png](images%2FSometimes%20OpenAI%20Echos%20My%20Question.png)
There is no use to ask it not to echo in the command.

### Issue: Actual Tokens of Request is Not Accurately Estimated
Before sending the request, the tokens calculated is not the same as the actual response.

### Issue: In The Old Version (v1.0.0), It Sometimes Says It Cannot Complete My Request Due To Unclear Break. 
#### Differences in Test Versions

**v1.0.0 (old version)**

In the previous version, I removed all the spaces between sentences to save tokens sent in the request.
![Flow_v1_0_0.jpg](images%2FFlow_v1_0_0.jpg)

Sometimes I got the following responses according to the above flow:
![Failure 4.png](images%2FFailure%204.png)
To fix this, I revised it as the following version, which spaces will be sent via request. And that cost more tokens.

**v1.1.0 (current version)**
![Flow_v1_1_0_revised.jpg](images%2FFlow_v1_1_0_revised.jpg)

Sometimes it still responses that the context are not coherent sentences.
